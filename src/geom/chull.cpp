/*!
  Find convex hull for an array of points
  \param P points array
  \param n number of points
  \return number of points in the convex hull

  If \c r is the number of points returned by this function, the input array is
  rearranged so that the first \c r points make the convex hull.

 Works in O(n log n); I think a bit faster than Graham scan;
 somewhat like Procedure 8.2 in Edelsbrunner's "Algorithms in Combinatorial
 Geometry", and very close to:
 <pre>A.M. Andrew, "Another Efficient Algorithm for Convex Hulls in Two Dimensions",
  Info. Proc. Letters 9, 216-219 (1979)</pre>
 (See also http://geometryalgorithms.com/Archive/algorithm_0110/algorithm_0110.htm)

 The results should be "robust", and not return a wildly wrong hull, despite
 using floating point.
