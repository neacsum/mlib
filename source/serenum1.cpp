  \defgroup serenum Serial Port Enumeration
  \brief Functions for retrieving available serial ports.

  These functions are heavily inspired from [CEnumerateSerial] (http://www.naughter.com/enumser.html)
  code.

  From the original code I've removed methods that don't seem to be working
  (ComDBOpen) or that take a ridiculous amount of time to execute (GetDefaultCommConfig).

  In the end I was left with three methods: using CreateFile, using SetupAPI and using
  the registry. The CreateFile method has no particular advantage except that it is
  conceptually very simple. The setup API is a bit slower (about 15 ms per port on my machine)
  but it returns also the friendly port name. The registry method is blazing fast
  (under 1 ms) but does not provide the friendly name.
